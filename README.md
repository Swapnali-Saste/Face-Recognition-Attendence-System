# Face-Recognition-Attendence-System
Developed a web-based Face Recognition Attendance System using Python and OpenCV to automate attendance tracking. The system captures real-time images, processes them using a machine learning model for facial recognition, and marks attendance accurately. Designed for scalability, the platform can handle multiple users and stores attendance records in a secure database for future reference.
